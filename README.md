### Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

1. **index.html:** Contains the structure of the web page, including the layout, main content, and forms for ordering and payment.
2. **style.css:** Defines the styles and layout for the entire application. It includes responsive design considerations and enhances the visual appeal.
