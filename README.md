# Quik - Instant Delivery App

Quik is a web application built to provide users with a seamless instant delivery experience. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with modular code organization for maintainability. It features a responsive design to ensure optimal user experience across various devices.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Markup language for structuring the application.
- **CSS3:** Styling language for designing the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for dynamic and interactive behavior of the app.
- **FontAwesome 6.5.1:** Icon library for enhanced visual elements.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized into three main files:

1. **index.html:** Contains the structure of the web page, including the layout, main content, and forms for ordering and payment.

2. **style.css:** Defines the styles and layout for the entire application. It includes responsive design considerations and enhances the visual appeal.

3. **script.js:** Implements the dynamic behavior of the app. It handles user interactions, updates the order list, and manages the checkout process. The code is modular, using functions to improve readability and maintainability.

4. **data.js:** Includes a menu array containing details about each item, such as name, ingredients, price, and quantity. UUID is generated using the `uuid` library for unique identification.

### Features and Functionality

1. **Interactive Menu Rendering:**
   - The `getFeedHtml` function dynamically generates HTML based on the menuArray data.
   - Each menu item includes details such as emoji, name, ingredients, price, and add/remove buttons.

2. **Shopping Cart Functionality:**
   - The `handleBasketButtonClick` function responds to user clicks on add or remove buttons in the cart.
   - The quantity and total price are updated in real-time.

3. **Order List Updates:**
   - The `updateOrderList` function dynamically updates the order list with items added to the cart.
   - It calculates and displays the total price.

4. **Checkout Process:**
   - The `checkOut` function triggers the display of the payment form when the user clicks the checkout button.
